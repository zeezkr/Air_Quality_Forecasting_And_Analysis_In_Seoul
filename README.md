# Air_Quality_Forecasting_And_Analysis_In_Seoul

## Introduction:

Air pollution is a critical environmental concern that significantly impacts public health and urban sustainability. Air pollution remains one of the leading environmental and health challenges worldwide, particularly in densely populated urban areas like Seoul, South Korea. The Air Quality Dataset (2017–2020) provides comprehensive hourly records of key air pollutants, enabling researchers to analyze trends, detect anomalies, and forecast air quality variations. 

This study focuses on univariate time series analysis of PM2.5 concentrations in Seoul (2017–2020). 

## Features:

Measurement date:
Timestamp of the air quality measurement .

Station code:
Identifier for the monitoring station.

PM2.5(Particulate Matter < 2.5µm):
Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller, which can penetrate the respiratory system.

PM10	   (Particulate Matter <10µm):
Particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or smaller.

NO2     (Nitrogen Dioxide):
Nitrogen dioxide, primarily produced from vehicle emissions and industrial processes.

SO2     (Sulfur Dioxide):
A toxic gas produced by burning fossil fuels.

CO	(Carbon Monoxide):
Carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless gas produced by burning carbon-based fuels.

O3     (Ozone):
Ozone, which can be beneficial in the upper atmosphere.
